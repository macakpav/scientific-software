\section{What changes did you make to your code after feedback? Do you wish to comment on your previous report?}

\section{What changes did you have to make to your code in order to implement the new functionality in your existing program?}

\section{Comment on the choices you made when implementing the code for finding the optimal $\beta$. Which convergence criterion did you use? How did you perform your timings? Where do you allocate memory? \dots}

\section{Place your three tables for forward Euler, backward Euler and Heun here. What do you observe? Explain any unexpected results. Which algorithm did you pick and why?}

\section{What effect do the optimization flags have? Are there other flags which may be useful when compiling your code?}

\section{What do you see when you run your code under valgrind?}

\section{Did you test on different compilers?}

\section{Which LAPACK routine did you select for the eigenvalue computation? Which subroutine parameters do you use? Which ones do you not use? Why?}

\section{What are the eigenvalues that you compute?}
